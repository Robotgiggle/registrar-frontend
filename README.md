# Registrar Web Interface

This is an archive of the Angular site I created in summer 2024 as a frontend interface for Columbia Business School's registrar system. This archive exists only as an example of my work - building the site from these files and attempting to use it will fail, as it relies on a variety of API endpoints which are not accessible outside the actual CBS Registrar app.

# Angular Info

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
